# Binary

Very simple gem to convert an integer into a binary representation

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'binary'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install binary

## Usage
Simply require the gem in your code:

```ruby
require 'binary'
```

Then to get the binary representation of a number, you just need to call `Binary.binary` and pass the number to it, something like follows:

```ruby
Binary.binary(2018)
```
Output: `"11111100010"`.
